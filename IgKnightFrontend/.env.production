# Production Environment Configuration
#
# CRITICAL: Update these URLs before deploying to production!
#
# PROTOCOL AUTO-DETECTION:
# - If variables are set, they are used as-is
# - If variables are omitted, protocol auto-detects from window.location:
#   - https://yourdomain.com → wss://yourdomain.com (for WebSockets)
#   - https://yourdomain.com → https://yourdomain.com (for HTTP APIs)
#
# RECOMMENDED PRODUCTION SETUP:
# Set these to your actual production URLs:

# API Gateway URL (HTTPS in production)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# WebSocket URL (WSS in production - CRITICAL for HTTPS sites)
VITE_WS_BASE_URL=wss://api.yourdomain.com

# STOMP WebSocket URL (HTTPS in production)
VITE_STOMP_WS_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# ALTERNATIVE: Use auto-detection by commenting out all variables above
# The app will automatically use the correct protocol based on how it's loaded
# Example: https://yourdomain.com → wss://yourdomain.com/ws/game
