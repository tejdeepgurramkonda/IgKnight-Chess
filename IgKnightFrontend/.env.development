# Development Environment Configuration
# 
# PROTOCOL AUTO-DETECTION:
# - If you set full URLs (ws://, wss://, http://, https://), they will be used as-is
# - If you omit these variables, protocol is auto-detected from window.location:
#   - http://localhost:5173 → ws://localhost:8087
#   - https://localhost:5173 → wss://localhost:8087
#
# For local development, you can either:
# 1. Set full URLs (explicit control)
# 2. Comment them out (auto-detection)

# API Gateway (HTTP/HTTPS auto-detected if omitted)

VITE_WS_BASE_URL=ws://localhost:8087

# STOMP WebSocket for chat (HTTP/HTTPS auto-detected if omitted)
